Technical Requirements
- I would use GKE, because of their requirement of containerization  and automatic scaling. 
It is also has strong security features and is highly reliable, which is both needed when you are working with user data.
One could arge to go for GCF, which has a lower effort to manage and is serverless, but can also accommodate microservice applications.
But because GKE is more focused towards containerization and cluster management i would go with that.

- As for which storage service, i would use Firestore that it fulfills most requirements and has practically no downside 
compared to other storage services that google cloud provides.

- Networking design would have to take connectivity, security, scalability and performance into account, because they want a global reach and latency optimization. 
For this you should use some load balancing as well and maybe use IAM and have firewall rules as well as subnets, to divide the VPC for organization and security.

- Data security and IAM is a must have when working with personal data. 
Only specific people should have access to users personal data and it should most definitely be stored securely.


Non-Technical Requirements
- Wanting global reach and secure data, works really well with a microservice architecture that GKE can provide. 
Each country has its different rules about what counts as personal data, meaning you might need multiple databases to handle this issues. 
It is also easily scalable and maintainable. 
It will cost a lot of computing power and money for this to work, so they might need a bigger budget for it.
